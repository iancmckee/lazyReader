#Thanks for checking out the Repo!
## A lot of inspiration came from the following repo detecting head nodding/shaking https://gist.github.com/smeschke/e59a9f5a40f0b0ed73305d34695d916b

### There are some built in commands that can customize how much you have to look up/ look down
  - CTRL+ALT removes existing trigger limites (defaults to 35)
  - CTRL+F1 this sets the lookup/ scroll down limit to the y-movement you're currently at
  - CTRL+F2 this sets the look down/ scroll up limit to the y-movement you're currently at
  - ESC will reinitialize your face. if you move around a lot it loses where your face it. if you don't see the dot in between your eyes i'd click esc
